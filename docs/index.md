# Welcome to the FAST ANIMATION STUDIO TOOLS 
#or...FAST 
#WIP Documentation
(I'm constantly updating this add-on and documentation!)


**FAST ANIMATION STUDIO TOOLS** is a Blender Add-on designed by a person who is making their own Sitcom in Blender, called "Toapy & Friends". 

So it is dedicated to fine tuning Blender so you can save as many button clicks as possible toward the end of FAST animation production. Using the tools I designed as well as the workflow I designed, for example, leveraging DAZ STUDIO toward this end, and its HUGE COLLECTION Of pre-made assets ready to go in one click, WILL suit the needs of all people dedicated to high production of video content in Blender.  You may look at the DAZ STORE And notice some off things but Before you make a final decision know: 

#1 These people are amazing 3D artists
#2 but a few not so good in the making a render department 
#3 but most are I feel really capture amazing art 
#4 Anything you buy on the DAZ STORE is really easily fixable 
#5 You might see characters with weird expressions, but know, 
#    those are all easily fixable with DAZ STUDIOS
#    inbuilt Morph and Hair Morph Sliders
